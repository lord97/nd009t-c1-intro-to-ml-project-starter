# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### Mohamed Bachir SANOU

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
When I generated the first predictions with AutoGluon I discovered two issues that Kaggle rejects:
1. Negative counts the raw model could occasionally produced values < 0, which is impossible for bike rentals and triggers a Kaggle error. So using the guideline provided in the notebook i fixed this kind of issue
2. Submission format : Kaggle expects exactly two columns named datetime and count




### What was the top ranked model that performed?


In the initial training phase, AutoGluon's leaderboard showed `WeightedEnsemble_L3` as the best performing model with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of -53.0458. This ensemble model combined predictions from multiple base models.
The weighted ensemble approach proved effective for this regression task by combining different modeling strategies to create a more robust predictor. The public score was 1.79608


## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
The exploratory analysis revealed several important insights about the bike sharing dataset:

1. **Initial Distribution Analysis**:
   - Created histograms of all numerical features to understand their distributions
   - Visualized the relationships between different variables and rental counts
   
2. **Temporal Patterns**:
   - Hour of day showed strong influence on bike rentals:
     - Peak demand during commuting hours (8 AM and 5-6 PM)
     - Low demand during early morning hours
   - Weekday vs weekend patterns emerged in the daily analysis
   - Monthly analysis showed seasonal trends with higher demand in summer months

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   Added several time-based features to capture these patterns by tranforming datetime feature:
   - `hour`: Extracted from datetime to capture daily rental patterns
   - `day`: Extracted day of week (0-6) to capture weekly patterns
   - `month`: Extracted to capture seasonal trends

4. **Categorical Improvements**:
   - Converted `season` and `weather` to categorical types for better model interpretation
   - This helps the model treat these features as discrete categories rather than continuous numbers

These additional features significantly improved the model's performance because they explicitly captured the temporal patterns that influence bike rental behavior.

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
The model's performance improved significantly after adding the additional features:

1. **Performance Improvement**:
   - Initial model: RMSE score of 1.79608 on Kaggle
   - After feature engineering: RMSE score of 0.53143
   - This represents a ~70% improvement in prediction accuracy

2. **Reasons for Improvement**:
   - **Time-Based Pattern Capture**: The new temporal features (hour, day, month) helped the model understand:
     - Daily commuting patterns
     - Weekend vs weekday differences
     - Seasonal variations in bike rental demand
   
   - **Better Category Handling**: Converting 'season' and 'weather' to categorical types allowed the model to:
     - Properly interpret discrete categories
     - Avoid treating these features as continuous numerical values
     - Create more appropriate decision boundaries

3. **Model Understanding**:
   - The additional features provided explicit information that was previously hidden in the datetime column
   - This allowed the model to learn more meaningful patterns and relationships in the data
   - The engineered features aligned well with real-world factors that influence bike rental behavior

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
he hyperparameter optimization (HPO) resulted in further improvements to the model's performance:

1. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Initial model score: 1.79608
   - After feature engineering: 0.53143
   - After hyperparameter tuning: 0.51194
   - This represents an additional ~3.7% improvement over the feature-engineered model

2. **Hyperparameters Optimized**:
   - Neural Network parameters:
     - Learning rate
     - Activation functions
     - Dropout probability
   - LightGBM parameters:
     - Number of boosting rounds
     - Number of leaves
   - Random Forest parameters:
     - Number of estimators
     - Maximum depth
     - Minimum samples per leaf
     - Maximum features

3. **Key Findings**:
   - HPO helped fine-tune the base models, leading to better ensemble predictions
   - The improvement was smaller than with feature engineering, suggesting that the feature selection was more impactful than parameter tuning for this problem
   - But by combining feature engineering and parameter tunning we can have a good result

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
Given more time with this dataset, I would focus on several key areas:

1. **Advanced Feature Engineering**:
   - Create interaction features between weather and time periods
   - Add holiday-specific features and special event indicators
   - Develop more sophisticated temporal features like rolling averages
   - Engineer features to capture weather pattern changes

2. **Data Preprocessing Improvements**:
   - Implement more sophisticated outlier detection and handling
   - Explore different scaling methods for numerical features
   - Investigate feature selection techniques to remove redundant features
   - Apply more advanced categorical encoding methods

3. **Model Experimentation**:
   - Try other algorithms 
   - Experiment with different ensemble techniques
   - Test deep learning approaches with custom architectures
   - Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**:
   - Increase the number of trials in hyperparameter search
   - Try different optimization strategies (Bayesian, genetic algorithms)
   - Perform more focused tuning on the best performing models
   - Experiment with custom hyperparameter search spaces

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.
|model|hpo1|hpo2|hpo3|score|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|initial|default values|default values|default values|1.79608|
|add_features|default values|default values|default values|0.53143|
|hpo|learning_rate; activation; dropout_prob|num_boost_round; num_leaves|n_estimators; max_depth; min_samples_leaf; max_features|0.51194|

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.
